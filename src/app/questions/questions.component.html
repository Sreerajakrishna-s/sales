               The forecasting horizon for sales predictions depends on the specific requirements of your business and the available historical data. Generally, you can predict sales for short-term periods (e.g., days, weeks, or months) or extend predictions for longer-term projections (e.g., quarters, years) based on the available data and the level of accuracy desired.
